- 👋 Hi, I’m @higgy300
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering in general. I prefer the backend to the front as I don't have many skills with frontend frameworks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning kafka, graphql, cassandra, cockroachDB and elasticsearch
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on java/python/c++ applications
- 📫 How to reach me: message me here
